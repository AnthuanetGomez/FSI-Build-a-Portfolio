  <!--Create a DIV element to contain the page content-->
  <div class="page">
    <!--Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text-->
    <H1>
      Anthuanet Gomez Blacido
    </H1>
    <!--Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"-->
    <H2>
      Software Developer
    </H2>
    <!--Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line-->
  </div>
  <hr />

  <!--Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")-->
  <p>My favorite thing about programming is that is a whole different thing that someone as a person can do in life and
    you keep learning through the years.</p>
  <!--Make the word "favorite" italicized-->

  <!--Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!-->

  <!--Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"-->
  <H3>
    About Menu
  </H3>
  <!--Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!-->

  <!--Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"-->

  <!--Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"-->

  <!--Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text-->

  <!--Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"-->

  <!--Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)-->

  BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
  - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
  - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
