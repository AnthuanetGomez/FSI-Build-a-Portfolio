    you keep learning through the years.</p>

  <!--Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text-->
  <!--Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"-->
  <!--Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)-->
  <H3 class="Lasr-Part">
    Contact Me
  </H3>
  <p class="Phone_number">Phone:</p><p>(202)555-1234</p>

  <!--BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
  - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
  - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
